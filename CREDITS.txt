*** Open Source Software ***

A number of open source libraries are crucial foundations of vice. Most
importantly:

* Omar Cornut's Dear ImGui (github.com/ocornut/imgui)--the
  foundation of the user interface. One of the most fun parts of developing
  vice was having the excuse to go deep into the details of using ImGui.
* GLFW (www.glfw.org) and SDL2 (www.libsdl.org)--handling
  oh so many of the grungy details of multi-platform support.

Many thanks also to:

* @AllenDeng for the Go bindings for imgui (github.com/AllenDang/cimgui-go/imgui)
* The go-gl team for Go bindings for OpenGL (github.com/go-gl/gl),
  glfw (github.com/go-gl/glfw), and for the mathgl matrix library
  (github.com/go-gl/mathgl).
* veandco for the Go bindings for SDL2 (github.com/veandco/go-sdl2)
* Klaus Post for the optimized zstd decompressor in go
  (github.com/klauspost/compress)
* Juliette Foucaut for the IconFontCppHeaders library
  (github.com/juliettef/IconFontCppHeaders)
* The FreeType Developers; portions of this software are copyright
  2022 the FreeType project (www.freetype.org).
